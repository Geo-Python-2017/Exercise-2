# Using Classroom for Github
For the remaining exercises in the course we are using [Classroom for Github](https://github.com/education/classroom). 
Here, We'll give you a sense of how Classroom for Github works and what you need to do to accept your assignments and turn in the exercises.

## Classroom for Github
Classroom for Github is basically an application that helps you make private copies of an assignment that you can modify and 
submit as your answers for the exercises. We will create some template for an assignment that normally would include the following:

- A basic description of the assignment
- A list of problems for you to solve/answer
- Some "starter" Python code or codes that you need to modify for the assignment
- Some data files to use with the Python scripts

For each exercise, We will post a link to the assignment (such as `https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/a3e02d425c06db7948bcfe7ae78043`). 

When you click the link, you will be taken to a web page where you can accept the assignment [1]:

When you accept the assignment a copy of it will be made in your personal Github repositories [2], and you will be asked to make changes to the Python code and main document for each assignment. More on that below.

### Footnotes
[1]: Note that the first time you accept an assignment you will need to authorize the application on Github. This will not work if you have not verified your email address for your Github account.<br/>
[2]: A repository on Github is basically like a folder for a given assignment/project.
